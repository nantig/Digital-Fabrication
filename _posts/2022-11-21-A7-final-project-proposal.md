## Concept

In looking back on all the things I've digitally fabricated this quarter, I found that my favourite project was the mold making and casting assignment. What I liked about that assignment was that digital farbication was used to create a final piece that still resembled an aspect of the hand crafted. The underlying concept guiding all of the following final project ideas is how might I use digital fabrication techniques to aid a process that evokes a handmade quality in the final product. 

### Record Cabinet Design

For my final project I'd like to design a record cabinet with a sliding door that uses living hinges.

My poor records would really like to get off the cold concrete floor. This project would give my records a home and give me an opportunity to play with living hinges and usign digital fabrication techniques on a larger scale project.

#### Inspiration

**Tambour Doors**

**Living Hinges**

#### Methods

1. Rhino - for modeling the cabinet parts 
2. Grasshopper - for modeling the living hinge design
3. Subtractive Manufacturing - milling the parts out of plywood sheets
4. Interface Fits - in the jounery of the cabinet

#### The Catch...

I conceptualized this project to utalize a tool I've been iitching to buy for a while, a Shaper Origin! The catch is that I dont have one yet...

 The new version of the Origin was only released at the end of October and retailers won't be receiving stock until early December. I placed an order for a Shaper Origin at my local woodshop, but no one has been able to give me a concrete estimate on when it will arrive. I was told that drop orders should arrive sooner than store stock, so there is a slight chance I will be able to get it in time for this project. My record cabinet project will definitely happen, it just might not happen as the final for this class. 

#### Timeline

![Timeline](/Digital-Fabrication/assets/images/A7-5.png)

*note: I know that I could probably complete the same project using the CNC mill at The8. However, given that many of the machines have had operation issues throughout the quareter, I am hesitant to rely so much on a machine when there is only one available. Instead, I created a proposal for a contingency project (details below)*

#### Bill of Materials

| Material      | Description | Status |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Shaper Origin (v2) | Primary tool used for subtractive manufacturing process. (on order) | ⚠️ |
| Veneered Plywood | Primary material used in cabinet design. Will purchase from Woodcrafters woodworking supply if the origin arrives in time.  | ❌ |
| Edge Banding | Used to hide the layered edge on plywood. (also will purchase from Woodcrafters is the origin arrives in time) | ❌ |
| Disc sander & sanding pads | For finishing surfaces | ✅ |
| Titebond III wood glue | For gluing surfaces | ✅ |


<!-- | Name | Description | ✅ ❌ ⚠️ | -->


## Contingency Plans

Since there is a pretty good chance that I won't be able to make the record cabinet, I have a contingency project that I will work on concurrently until I get more info on when my Shaper Origin should arrive. The contingency plan project are two smaller projects that I wanted to do anyway! 

### Plan B: Parametric Candles 

I had a lot of fun making candles for the casting and mold making assignment. Through that, I learned that there is so much to explore in the candle making space, and I'd like to do just that. I also think that they would make fun gifts for friends and family. 

Here's the first parametric candle 3D printed part. I plan to make a collection of 3 designs for this project. 

![3d printed candle mold](/Digital-Fabrication/assets/images/A7-3.jpeg)

#### Methods

1. Grasshopper - modeling candle surface patterns and shapes 
2. Rhino - modeling mold forms
3. 3D Printing - printing parts to cast silicone molds from
4. Casting - casting silicone molds, and then casting candles from the silicone molds
5. (maybe) Incorporating stock parts - if any of the candles fit into standard stock candle holders

#### Bill of Materials

| Material      | Description | Status |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 3D printing filament | For making molds for molds | ✅ |
| Oomoo 25 | For casting silicone molds | ✅ |
| Candle Wax | For making pillar candles. May need to order more if I make more than 5lbs of candles. | ✅ ⚠️|
| Essential oils | For scenting candles | ✅ |
| Wax dye chips | For coloring candles | ✅ |


### & maybe some Block Printing

I have a couple block printing sets that I bought from a company called Block Shop Textiles. I really love these kits and I've used them for making custom wrapping paper and cards. I noticed that all the blocks are laser cut and laser etched. I want to exapnd on my collection of blocks by making larger laser cut shapes and using milling instead of laser etching for the more detailed pattern blocks. This is also a good way for me to use up some scrap wood that I've had lying around for a while! 

![printing blocks](/Digital-Fabrication/assets/images/A7-6.jpeg)

#### Methods

1. Grasshopper - modeling and manipulating parts quickly 
2. Rhino - modeling 
3. Laser cutting - for making simple block prints
4. Subtractive manufacturing with the othermill - for making more complicated patterned blocks

#### Bill of Materials

| Material      | Description | Status |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Misc. scrap wood | For creating wooden blocks | ✅ |
| Printing ink | For printing with wooden blocks. (May purchase more, but that can be done locally from any art supply store) | ✅ ⚠️ |
| Paper | For printing on. | ✅ |
| Fabric (tbd) | For pringing on, if I decide I want to do some fabric prints, like tote bags or bandanas | ❌ |

#### Timeline

I designed this as a two-part project because casting candles is a lot of up-front work with the mold making, but is fairly passive when actually casting the wax. I figured that two smaller projects would be a fun way for me to explore more of the methods we learned throughout the quarter!
