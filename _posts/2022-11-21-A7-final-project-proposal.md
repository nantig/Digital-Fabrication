## Concept

In looking back on all the things I've digitally fabricated this quarter, I found that my favourite project was the mold making and casting assignment. What I liked about that assignment was that digital farbication was used to create a final piece that still resembled an aspect of the hand crafted. The underlying concept guiding all of the following final project ideas is how might I use digital fabrication techniques to aid a process that evokes a handmade quality in the final product. 

### Record Cabinet Design

For my final project I'd like to design a record cabinet with a sliding door that uses living hinges.

My poor records would really like to get off the cold concrete floor. This project would give my records a home and give me an opportunity to play with living hinges and usign digital fabrication techniques on a larger scale project.

#### Methods

1. Rhino - for modeling the cabinet parts 
2. Grasshopper - for modeling the living hinge design
3. Subtractive Manufacturing - milling the parts out of plywood sheets
4. Interface Fits - in the jounery of the cabinet

#### The Catch...

I conceptualized this project to utalize a tool I've been iitching to buy for a while, a Shaper Origin! The catch is that I dont have one yet...

 The new version of the Origin was only released at the end of October and retailers won't be receiving stock until early December. I placed an order for a Shaper Origin at my local woodshop, but no one has been able to give me a concrete estimate on when it will arrive. I was told that drop orders should arrive sooner than store stock, so there is a slight chance I will be able to get it in time for this project. My record cabinet project will definitely happen, it just might not happen as the final for this class. 

#### Timeline



#### Bill of Materials

| Material      | Description | Status |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Shaper Origin (v2) | Primary tool used for subtractive manufacturing process. (on order) | ⚠️ |
| Veneered Plywood | Primary material used in cabinet design. Will purchase from Woodcrafters woodworking supply if the origin arrives in time.  | ❌ |
| Edge Banding | Used to hide the layered edge on plywood. (also will purchase from Woodcrafters is the origin arrives in time) | ❌ |
| Disc sander & sanding pads | For finishing surfaces | ✅ |
| Titebond III wood glue | For gluing surfaces | ✅ |

## Contingency Plans



### Plan B: Parametric Candles 

#### Methods

1. Grasshopper - modeling candle surface patterns and shapes 
2. Rhino - modeling mold forms
3. 3D Printing - printing parts to cast silicone molds from
4. Casting - casting silicone molds, and then casting candles from the silicone molds
5. (maybe) Incorporating stock parts - if any of the candles fit into standard stock candle holders

#### Bill of Materials

| Material      | Description | Status |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 3D printing filament | For making molds for molds | ✅ |
| Oomoo 25 | For casting silicone molds | ✅ |
| Candle Wax | For making pillar candles. May need to order more if I make more than 5lbs of candles. | ✅ ⚠️|
| Essential oils | For scenting candles | ✅ |
| Wax dye chips | For coloring candles | ✅ |



### & maybe some Block Printing
