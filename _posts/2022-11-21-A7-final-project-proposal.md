## Concept

In looking back on all the things I've digitally fabricated this quarter, I found that my favourite project was the mold making and casting assignment. What I liked about that assignment was that digital farbication was used to create a final piece that still resembled an aspect of the hand crafted. The underlying concept guiding all of the following final project ideas is how might I use digital fabrication techniques to aid a process that evokes a handmade quality in the final product. 

## Plan A: Record Cabinet



## Contingency Plans

### Plan B: Candles



### Plan C: Block Printing Blocks
