## Lamps pt. 1: Design

I definitely spent too much time playing with meshes this week, and not enough time working on my lighting design. Here's what I've got so far. 

### Inspiration 

Akshay and I were wondering around Ballard and went into Woodland Mod. Amongst the many beautiful things in that shop, they had a collection of small 3D printed vases by a company called Minimum Design. What I liked about these vases is that they used simple patterns with crisp lines to create beautiful patterned forms. I decided to use this as a jumping off point for my light design.

Not related to lights, but soemthing that intrigued me about these 3D printed objects is that they claim to be made of 30% wood and 70% bioplastic. My one complaint about 3D printing so far has been the amount of plastic waste it generates. I've found some 3D printing filaments that claim to be biodegradable, but none that looked like they would produce the print quality of these vases. I'd really like to know what filament they are using! 

### Sketches

Here are a few preliminary sketches of what lamb designs inspired by the Minimum Design vases may look like.

### Electrical Components 

These are the electrical components that I am using for the light fixture. My plan is that the lamp shade design will have an opening at the top that is wide enough to fit the plug through it but narrow enough that the it can rest comfortably on the slightly tapered silicone edge of the lightbulb housing.

The widest part of the plug measures 31.31 mm 

The bulb housing is 15.35 mm at the top and 44.60 mm at its widest point. 
The bulb housing (without a bulb) measures 95.04 mm in length, of which about 40.00 mm should protrude from the top of the lamp shade. 

### Grasshopper Explorations 

*In-progress*

I've started playing around in grasshopper, but all I've maganged to make is a mess. I've got some modeling ahead of me this week.
