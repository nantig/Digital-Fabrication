*note: I'm running tight on time, so I'm just adding photos for week 1, and will come back and add descriptions to my process before my final submission in week 2!*

## Candles! 

My mom really loves pine cones, so I thought it would be nice to make her some pine cone candles that smell like fraiser fir (basically, candles that small like christmas). 

*cast candles coming soon!*

## Test casts

Even though I am planning to make candles, I wanted to test out centering the wick and using the mold wiht the hydrostone provided. I was surprised how much of the 3D print detail was picked up by the silicone. Seeing all of the layers from the 3D print isn't exactly the surface texture I was hoping for. I'm currently working on smoothing the surface of my mold with sulfer-free clay and hope to cast a second mold off of that for a better surface texture.

## Process 

I started with a [pinecone STL that I downloaded from Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4678027).  

I designed quite a few versions of my 3D print before landing on the final design. Here's a snap shot of some of those models.

Here is the final version of the pieces for my 3D printed mold shell
