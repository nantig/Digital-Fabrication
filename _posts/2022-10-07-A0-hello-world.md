Hello! Welcome to my digital fabrication site. This is where I will make weekly posts about the work I am doing in HCDE 533 Digital Fabrication. 

Stay tuned for my first project, and in the meantime head over to my [About](Digital-Fabrication/about) page to learn a little bit more about who I am and why I'm excited to make some digital creations!
