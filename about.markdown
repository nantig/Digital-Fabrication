Hi! I'm Noelle. 

I make things. Sometimes they are physical things (like carved spoons), and sometimes digital things (like apps). I'm excited for this class because it means I get to make physical things digitally. 

My background is in Furniture Design, so I know a thing or two about fabrication and thinking in 3D. I've done a little bit of digital fabrication in the past, but I only dabbled. My goals for this class are to expand my knowledge of digital fabrication and become more confident in using the software and tools. But mostly, I'm here because I want to have fun making stuff.

I'm excited to get to work with others making things again! I know a little bit about a lot of things, and I'm always happy to share what I know with others. I've dabbled in web development, so I can help with HTML and CSS (or setting up a Jekyll blog like I've done here)! I can also help with Rhino, model making, casting, machine maintenance, and troubleshooting!
